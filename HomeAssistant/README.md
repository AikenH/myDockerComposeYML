## file explain

**INSTALL**:

**startup.sh & docker-compose.yml** can both install HA in docker (container ver.), choose one of them is enough.

**AFTER INSTALL**:

use **configuration** to replace file in container, which provide some system info monitor like CPU usage, Memory usage on HA. Those info whill show up as entities in HA.

Thanks lot.
